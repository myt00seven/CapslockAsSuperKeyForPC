# What is this project 
This project origins as I was trying to immigrant my key bindings on Mac with Karabiner for PC with Autohotkey. I was very used to the idea of super key brought by [Vonng's Capslock project](https://github.com/Vonng/Capslock) so that I decide to create a simplified mirror in Autohotkey. 
Credits should also go to the [Stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40435980/how-to-emulate-hyper-key-in-windows-10-using-autohotkey) that I learned how to map Capslock key to a Hyper key.

# Usage
To use this script is very easy, simply run the SuperKey4WinWithAutoHotKey.awk file with your AutoHotkey.
